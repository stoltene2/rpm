h1. Purpose

If you are here then you must know the pains of dealing with numerous Rpm packages in a Linux distribution.

The goal of this library is to provide a rich set of combinators for dealing with a collection of Rpm packages.

Once you have the code you can:

* Configure the test and coverage executable with cabal configure -ftests -fhpc

* Build the library with _cabal build_

* Create documentation with cabal haddock

Usage examples to come soon.
